js-visualizer
=============

js-visualizer is a HTML5 / Javascript visualization experiment.

Inspired by this very awesome codepen:  http://codepen.io/soulwire/pen/Dscga

Eventually to come:
  - Spotify integration
  - Really fancy background stuff

Currently, it is a lot of code observered / analyzed from these tutorials & projects:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API
https://github.com/mdn/voice-change-o-matic/blob/gh-pages/scripts/app.js#L128-L205
 
Soon all of their code will be transformed / removed

To use, for now:
  - put a .mp3 file into the "audio" folder and rename the file to "test.mp3"
